Snake Game by amirZand99

This is a classic Snake game developed using Python's Pygame library by amirZand99.
The game features a snake that grows longer as it eats food, and the player must maneuver the snake to avoid colliding with the boundaries of the game screen or itself.

Features

    Snake Movement: Use the arrow keys to control the movement of the snake.
    Scoring: The player's score increases each time the snake eats food.
